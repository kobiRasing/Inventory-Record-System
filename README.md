# Inventory-Record-System
An inventory/record system for an auto repair shop that tracks which vehicles have received maintenance from the shop and the list of repairs made for that particular vehicle. The one who will be using this program to be created will be mainly the shop owner and employee, each having separate interfaces to work on.
